1. The program takes an integer input and counts the number of digits in it.
2. It then extracts each digit from left to right using a divisor and calculates the square of each digit.
3. The squares are concatenated to form a merged number by appending them in order.
4. The merged number is then displayed.
5. Finally, the merged number is reversed and printed as the final result.
